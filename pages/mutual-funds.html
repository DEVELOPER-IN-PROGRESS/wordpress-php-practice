                                invests primarily in equity securities of companies organized in the United States that
                                the Adviser believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor. The Fund
                                typically invests in a portfolio of 15 to 35 companies of various market capitalizations
                                and is considered an all-cap strategy. Although the Fund will invest primarily in the
                                equity securities of U.S. companies, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in
                                equity securities of foreign companies in countries classified as “developed” by MSCI.
                                The primary benchmark for the Fund is the Russell 3000 Value Index. Investors may also
                                be interested in comparing the Fund to the S&P 500 Index.</p>

                                investment team believes are high quality, though temporarily out of favor. The strategy
                                typically invests in a portfolio of 50 to 90 companies with market capitalizations
                                typically between the smallest and largest members of the Russell Mid Cap Index (defined
                                using a trailing 12 month average of the smallest and largest members on a month to
                                month basis). Although the strategy will invest primarily in the equity securities of

                                favor. In addition, the Fund will invest in 0-50 short equity securities that the
                                investment team believes have average to below average competitive positions and
                                unattractive risk reward profiles. Benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index, the Fund will

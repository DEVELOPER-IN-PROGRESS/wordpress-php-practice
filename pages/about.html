                <p>Nuance Investments is a classic value investment firm headquartered in Kansas City. Nuance was formed
                    on
                    the belief that the ability to outperform the broad stock market is predicated on a consistent and
                    disciplined value investing approach. The Nuance investment teamâ€™s sole focus is generating
                    investment
                    returns for clients by diligently reviewing one company at a time on its own investment merits.</p>
